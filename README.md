## This algorithm was made to determine whether there exist top, bottom, left, right neighbouring cells of a given index.
* Assume a grid of size M, N > 3
* Form a given point CP, which is digit from the grid, be the center for a 3x3 2d Matrix.

### Example: Given a grid of size M, N > 3 :<br>
<table>
  <thead>Example</thead>
  <th>
    <tr>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
  </th>
</table>
